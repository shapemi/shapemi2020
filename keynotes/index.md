<p align="justify">Ross Whitaker earned a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Princeton University in 1986, and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina in 1994.  Since 2000 he has been at the University of Utah, where he is a Professor in the School of Computing and the Scientific Computing
and Imaging Institute.  He is a recipient of the NSF Career Award andan IEEE and AIMBE Fellow.  He teaches discrete math, scientific visualization, probability and statistics, and image processing. He has leads a research group in image analysis, geometry processing, and scientific computing, with a variety of projects supported by both federal agencies and industrial contracts.  His published works have received over 14,000 citations.</p>

## Aasa Feragen

<p align="justify">Aasa Feragen completed her MSc (2005) and PhD (2010) degrees in mathematics from the University of Helsinki, after which she held postdocs at the University of Copenhagen (2009-2013) and the Max Planck Institute in TÃ¼bingen (2012-2013). Following several years as an Associate Professor at the University of Copenhagen (2014-), she is now Full Professor (2019-) at the Technical University of Denmark. Aasa's research sits at the intersection of machine learning and medical imaging, with a particular focus on graphs, trees and other complex data viewed from a geometric point of view. Of interest to the ShapeMI community, Aasa is co-chair of <a href="http://ipmi2021.org" target="_blank">IPMI 2021</a>, which we still hope to be able to hold at the beautiful island of Bornholm.</p>

## Stefan Sommer

<p align="justify">Stefan Sommer received his M.Sc. in mathematics in 2008, and his PhD in computer science in 2012 from the University of Copenhagen (UCPH). He is currently Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science, UCPH. His research interests include shape analysis; statistics and machine learning on data with complex, geometric structure (geometric statistics); and foundational aspects of reinforcement learning. Stefan is heading the machine learning and data science education at UCPH. He is coauthor of the book Riemannian Geometric Statistics in Medical Image Analysis. Together with Aasa Feragen, Julia Schnabel and Mads Nielsen, Stefan will chair the IPMI conference in June/July 2021.</p>
